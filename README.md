The viewer does not open when asked to in browser because of missing default app / mime config. <br />
I created these config files quick & dirty so still have change the username (meme) in used paths.<br />

After editing the usernames add the files into ~/.local/share/applications<br />

Before pasting blindly check if files may already exist.

I may add an install script in the future.<br />
